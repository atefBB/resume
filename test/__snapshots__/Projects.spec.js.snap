      <div>I started this project as a way of learning <mark>NuxtJS</mark> and <mark>Element</mark> component library. I have learned many skills through this and been I’m very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don’t have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one. I also explore the basis of <mark>Travis</mark> to compile this project and publish it on the <mark>Github page</mark> Finally, I am not a Web Designer but I would like to understand well the <mark>Dark Theme</mark> provide by Google. So this is why I manually modify the <mark>CSS</mark> to follow as many as possible <a href="https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html">Google recommandations</a>
